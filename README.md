# Hexagram
Programming Language: Java

A Hexagram is a 6-pointed star, sometimes called the Star of David. Given these numbers:
```text
3 17 15 18 11 22 12 23 21 7 9 13
```
There are four unique ways of assigning the numbers to vertices of the hexagram such that all of the sets of four numbers along the lines have the same sum (57 in this case). All other ways may be obtained from these by rotation and/or reflection.
